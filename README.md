Public health data have been captured in nine overarching categories: HIV/AIDS, cancer, nutrition/physical activity/obesity, food safety, infectious disease, maternal and child health, tobacco, injury/violence, and behavioral health/substance abuse. Overall, the dataset comprises of 13,512 records and 11 variables (includes numerical and categorical ones)
